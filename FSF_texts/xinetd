This is an exerpt from an email I recieved from the original author, allowing
xinetd as maintained by me (Rob Braun), to use the higher version numbers:

I appreciate your maintaining the version string guidelines as specified
in the copyright. But I did not mean them to last as long as they did.

So, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N >= 3) version string for future       
xinetd versions that you release. Note that I am excluding the 2.2.* line;      
using that would only create confusion. Naming the next release 2.3.0           
would put to rest the confusion about 2.2.1 and 2.1.8.*.
