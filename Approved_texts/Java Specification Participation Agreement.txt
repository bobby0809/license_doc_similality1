2. Participation.
A. The Process. Oracle and other JCP members have established a formal process (“Process”)
for the development of high quality Java Specifications and promoting the development and
distribution of compatible implementations of those specifications. The Process is described on the JCP
Web Site (at http:// jcp.org), and may be revised from time to time in accordance with terms set forth in
the Process document, provided that no such revisions shall apply to any JSR that has already been
approved for development. Upon execution of this Agreement by the parties, You are authorized to
participate in accordance with the Process (including through an employee or other agent designated by
and authorized to act on Your behalf) with respect to any JSR commenced once this version of the JSPA
JSPA - 2.0.1 19 October 2015 2
is available. Should you wish to participate in the Process with respect to a JSR commenced before this
version of the JSPA was available for execution, you must execute the version of the JSPA applicable to
that JSR (contact the PMO to obtain a copy). This Agreement shall control in the event of any conflict
between it and the Process. Any capitalized terms used herein and not defined in Section 1 above are as
defined in the Process document.
B. Evolution of Agreement. It is the intent of the Process that all Members execute a JSPA with
substantially similar terms and conditions, especially with respect to the Members represented on the
Expert Group for a particular JSR. However, the JSPA is an evolving document and may, as set forth in
the Process, be updated and re-posted on the JCP website from time-to-time. Subject to Section 10,
Members may elect to execute a newer version of the JSPA at any time, but are not obligated to do so
until their current JSPA expires or is otherwise terminated.
3. Process Cost Sharing.
You agree to pay the following applicable, annual fee for each term (per Section 10) in which you
participate in the Process. Initial the category that applies to you. For each term, Your fee shall be due
net thirty (30) days from the date of invoice.
Participant Category Annual Fee Initial:
Commercial Entity: $5,000.00/year
____________
Education, Government, non-profit organization: $2,000.00/year
____________
Fee Bearing Java Technology Source Code Licensees of Oracle: No Fee ____________
Individual representing self only No Fee -
____________
Only one annual fee shall be due even if You are a party to more than one JSPA at the same time (i.e.
different versions may be applicable to different JSRs).
4. Intellectual Property; In-Bound.
A. Contributions to the Spec Lead. You hereby grant to each Spec Lead (and, if different,
Maintenance Lead) for each Expert Group for which You are not the Spec Lead, with respect to the
Output of the JSR led by the Spec. Lead, a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully
paid-up and, subject to Section 4.D, irrevocable, license, with the right to sublicense:
I. Copyrights and Trade Secrets. Under Your (including, to the extent to which You have
the power to do so, Your Affiliates’) applicable copyrights and trade secret rights which You currently
have or may acquire in the future, to:
(a) incorporate any and all Contributions provided by You hereunder into current and future
versions of the Output;
(b) copy, disclose and distribute the Contributions provided by You as part of the Spec for
Community Review and Public Review and as part of the early access versions of the RI and TCK; and
(c) copy, modify, develop (including the right to authorize others to implement your
Contributions when such Contributions are incorporated into the Spec), disclose and distribute the
Contributions provided by You, all as part of the Output, on terms consistent with those specified in
Section 5 below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that works created by employees of the
Federal Government are not subject to copyright protection within the United States and may be copied
or used by interested parties.
JSPA - 2.0.1 19 October 2015 3
II. Patents.
(a) Under any applicable patent claims which You (including, to the extent to which you have
the power to do so, Your Affiliates) now have or acquire in the future with respect to Contributions
which are made by You in a recorded form (e.g. as a written document or as an email), to make, have
made, use, offer to sell, sell, or import Your Contributions as part of the Output, with the right to
sublicense, on terms consistent with those specified in Section 5 below. If Your Contribution is
included in the Specification, then the above license to use such Contribution as part of the Output
includes the right to implement such Contribution as part of a compatible implementation of the
Specification, per Section 5.B or 5.F respectively, under all of Your patent claims whose infringement
cannot be avoided in a technically feasible manner when implementing the Specification.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any sublicense granted by the Spec Lead pursuant to Sections 5.B or
5.F concerning Your patent claims whose infringement cannot be avoided in a technically feasible
manner when implementing the Specification shall terminate if (i) the sublicensee initiates a claim
against You that Your making, having made, using, offering to sell, selling or importing an
implementation of the Spec that satisfies requirements (a) - (c) above infringes such sublicensee's
patent rights, and (ii) there is no technically feasible, non-infringing alternative implementation of the
Spec that also satisfies requirements (a) - (c) of Section 5.B.
(b) For Contributions which You make but not in a recorded form, the provisions of Section 6,
and not this Section 4.A.II, shall apply, subject to any additional obligations You may have as the Spec
Lead pursuant to Section 5.
The Spec. Lead may sublicense or assign any or all of the rights granted to it in this Section 4.A to a
subcontractor for the development of the Output.
B. Grants to Other Expert Group Members. You hereby grant to Member represented on any
Expert Group on which You are also represented under Your applicable patents, copyrights and trade
secret rights which You currently have or may acquire in the future a perpetual, non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty- free, fully paid-up, irrevocable license to use Your Contributions for research and
development purposes related to the activities of such Expert Group. Similarly, Oracle makes the same
grant to You with respect to its Contributions concerning Expert Groups on which You are represented.
These grants, from You to other Members and from Oracle to You, shall not include distribution to third
parties of early access implementations of the Spec under development by Your Expert Group until the
draft Spec has been released for Public Review.
C. Contributions from Oracle and Ex-Spec Leads. For Contributions from Oracle under JSRs
for which You are the Spec Lead, Oracle hereby grants to You the same license with respect to Oracle’s
Contributions as does any other member with respect to its Contributions pursuant to Section 4.A.
Similarly, if with respect to a particular JSR You cease to be the Spec Lead before that JSR is
completed, then any and all of the comments, specifications, materials or ideas provided by You
hereunder, to the extent incorporated into any form of Output, shall be considered Contributions
licensed pursuant to Sections 4.A and 4.B.
D. Withdrawal of Contributions due to Change in Announced License Terms. If the Spec Lead
for an Expert Group in which You are participating makes significant changes to the terms and
conditions of any license granted pursuant to Sections 5.B or 5.F below after those terms and
conditions are first disclosed pursuant to the Process, then You may, upon giving notice to the
Specification Lead and the PMO, withdraw any copyright or patent licenses concerning Your
Contributions granted pursuant to Section 4.A.I or 4.A.II above (but not patent licenses granted by You
pursuant to Section 6 below).
JSPA - 2.0.1 19 October 2015 4
5. Intellectual Property; Out-Bound.
A. Ownership; Obligation to Publish Spec. Subject to each contributor’s underlying rights
in its own Contributions, the Spec Lead(s) for a particular JSR at the time of the final release of the
Specification shall own the copyright to the final Spec generated pursuant to that JSR under United
States copyright law. Promptly after its completion (i.e. passes Final Approval Ballot), such Spec will
be published by the PMO at the JCP Web Site.
B. License to Create Independent Implementations. For any Specification produced under a
new JSR, the Spec Lead for such JSR shall offer to grant a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully
paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable license under its licensable copyrights in and patent claims covering
the Specification (including rights licensed to the Spec Lead pursuant to Section 4.A and 4.C) to
anyone who wishes to create and/or distribute an Independent Implementation of the Spec. Such
license will authorize the creation and distribution of Independent Implementations provided such
Independent Implementations:
(a) fully implement the Spec(s) including all its required interfaces and functionality;
(b) do not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or
include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within the Licensor
Name Space other than those required/authorized by the Spec or Specs being implemented; and
(c) pass the TCK for such Spec.
For the purposes of this Section 5.B, patent claims covering the Specification shall mean any claims for
which there is no technically feasible way of avoiding infringement in the course of implementing the
Specification.
C. Reciprocity.
I. The Spec Lead may condition its offer of the license described in Section 5.B upon its
licensee’s commitment to offer to any party seeking a license from such licensee, if requested, a license
under such licensee’s patent rights which are or would be infringed by all technically feasible
implementations of the Spec on terms consistent with the provisions of Section 6.A excluding, for nonMembers, its subsections (bb) and (ee).
II. The Spec Lead also may condition its offer of the license described in Section 5.B
under its own applicable patent rights (whether or not necessarily infringed, and not including rights
licensed to the Spec Lead by other Contributors pursuant to Section 4.A.II) on a licensee not initiating a
claim that the Spec Lead, has, in the course of performing its responsibilities as the Spec Lead, induced
any other entity to infringe the licensee's patent rights.
III. No provision of this Section 5.C shall be construed to compel, restrict or limit the
terms on which the Spec Lead may grant or offer to grant patent licenses (or make non-assertion
covenants) concerning its own applicable patent rights (as opposed to rights licensed to the Spec Lead
by other Contributors pursuant to Section 4.A.II) whose infringement can be avoided in a technically
feasible manner when implementing the Spec.
Other than as set forth above, the Spec Lead agrees not to impose any contractual condition or covenant
that would limit or restrict the right of any licensee to create or distribute such Independent
Implementations. The Spec License may otherwise include as additional terms and conditions only
those that do not relate to the license grant but govern issues such as, without limitation, confidentiality,
applicable law, dispute resolution, export control and government rights in data provisions, warranties
and liabilities. In addition, the Spec Lead for each JSR hereby agrees that it will not use the rights
granted or licensed to it per Section 4.A to create or distribute an Independent Implementation of any
Spec produced under a JSR for which it is the Spec Lead that does not satisfy the requirements of
subparagraphs (a) through (c) above.
JSPA - 2.0.1 19 October 2015 5
D. Continued Availability. If the Specification produced under a new or revised Umbrella
JSR adopts by reference a Specification that previously had been available for implementation as an
Independent Implementation (“Stand-Alone Component”), then the Spec Lead for the Stand-Alone
Component may determine in its reasonable discretion and in accordance with the Process whether or
not to make the Stand- Alone Component available for Independent Implementation in its revised form
as promulgated under the Umbrella JSR. The Spec Lead for the Stand-Alone Component shall not
impinge on the right of a third party to create an Independent Implementation of the most recent prior
version of the Stand-Alone Component.
E. Downstream Licenses for Independent Implementations. A Downstream Licensee need
not include requirements (a)-(c) from Section 5.B or any other particular “pass through” requirements
in any license the Downstream Licensee grants concerning the use of its Independent Implementation
or products derived from it. However, except with respect to implementations of the Specification (and
products derived from them) by the Downstream Licensee’s licensee that satisfy requirements (a)-(c)
from Section 5.B, the Downstream Licensee may neither: (i) grant or otherwise pass through to its
licensees any licensable copy- rights and patent rights of the Spec Lead; nor (ii) authorize its licensees
to make any claims concerning their implementation’s compliance with the Spec in question.
F. Licensing of RI and TCK.
I. The Spec Lead (including Oracle) for a JSR approved by the JCP shall offer to any
interested party licenses concerning the RI and TCK -- and also the TCK separately when developed
under any JSR submitted hereafter -- on terms and conditions that are non-discriminatory, fair and
reasonable. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 5.F, such terms and conditions shall be
determined by the Spec Lead in its reasonable discretion.
II. With respect to the RI, the terms and conditions offered by the Spec Lead shall
include, at a minimum:
(a) under the Spec Lead's copyrights in the RI, the right to copy, modify the source
code portions of (excluding any Shared Code, except as provided for in Section 5.G) and distribute the
RI, in whole or in part, as part of a complete binary implementation of the corresponding Spec that
satisfies requirements (a) – (c) of Section 5.B; and
(b) under any patent claims licensable by the Spec Lead for which there is no
technically feasible way of avoiding infringement in the course of implementing the Specification or in
the use of unmodified RI code, the right to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell or import such
implementation; provided, however, the license offered pursuant to this Section 5.F.II may be
conditioned on the licensee's granting a reciprocal license to (or not initiating a claim against) the Spec
Lead or its licensees concerning any patent claims licensable by such licensee for which there is no
technically feasible way of avoiding infringement in the course of implementing the Specification or in
the use of unmodified RI code.
III. With respect to the TCK when licensed separately from the RI, for a Qualified Notfor- Profit or Qualified Individual there shall be no charge for the license offered by the Spec Lead.
IV. If the Spec Lead limits the scope of the licenses granted pursuant to this Section 5.F,
such limitations shall not be more extensive than: (i) they authorize the distribution of only such
products derived from the RI as satisfy substantially the same compatibility requirements as set forth in
Section 5.B(a)-(c) and any applicable TCK Users Guide; and (ii) they include provisions concerning
the licensing or non-enforcement of patent claims as stringent on licensees of the RI and TCK as the
provisions of Section 6 below are on You. The Spec Lead shall not include as part of the foregoing
license any additional contractual condition or covenant concerning compatibility that would limit or
restrict the right of any licensee to create or distribute products derived from the RI. Notwithstanding
JSPA - 2.0.1 19 October 2015 6
the foregoing, neither this subparagraph IV nor Section 5.F.II (concerning reciprocal patent licensing,
shall be understood to require Oracle to modify license agreements for Java technology that Oracle has
in place, or to modify or replace in future license agreements for Java technology provisions
comparable to those currently in place, where the RI and/or TCK would be covered by such license
agreements. This proviso shall not be understood to exempt Oracle, when it is the Spec Lead, from the
obligation to license the TCK separate from the corresponding RI code when the Spec is developed
under any JSR submitted hereafter.
V. No provision of this Section 5.F shall be understood to require that the Spec Lead
license the RI (or TCK) in source code form, but neither shall it be understood to relieve the Spec Lead
of its obligations concerning the RI and the TCK under the Process.
VI. If in conjunction with licensing the RI a Spec Lead also makes the corresponding
Spec available to the licensee of the RI as part of the license, then the Spec Lead shall do so on terms
and conditions consistent with Section 5.B(a)-(c), except that an implementation of the Spec under such
license may incorporate parts of the RI that are not Shared Code (i.e. such implementation need not be
an Independent Implementation).
G. Shared Code. For Specs developed under new JSRs, if it is determined in accordance
with the Process that a fully compatible implementation of the Spec cannot be achieved without use of
Shared Code, then the Spec Lead shall grant a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up,
royalty free license under its applicable intellectual property rights to allow anyone to incorporate the
Shared Code as part of an Independent Implementation of the Spec that satisfies requirements (a)-(c) of
Section 5.B. Such license may not authorize the licensee to modify the Shared Code except to the
extent necessary to enable its incorporation into the licensee’s Independent Implementation.
H Admission Against Interest. Oracle acknowledges that Your entering into this Agreement
shall not be understood to estop any defenses that you otherwise could make to a claim by Oracle or
any third party that Your creation, display, reproduction or distribution of an implementation of a
Specification infringes Oracle’s or such third party’s copyright, if any, in such Specification.
6. Special Patent Considerations.
A. Grant. With respect to the Output of JSRs for which You are not the Spec Lead, You (on
behalf of yourself and any party for which You are authorized to act with respect to this Agreement)
hereby agree to grant under each patent claim that You and/or such party own, will own or have the
authority to license, after adoption of the Spec, to all licensees under Section 5 and on fair, reasonable
and non-discriminatory terms a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license within
the scope of the licenses granted in Sections 5.B and 5.F to:
(a) use the TCK; and
(b) where there is no technically feasible alternative that would avoid infringing the
patent claim, either use the licensed RI, in whole or in part, as part of an implementation of the Spec(s)
in question that satisfies requirements (a)–(c) of Section 5.B or develop, distribute, and use an
Independent Implementation;
However, You shall not be required to grant a license:
(aa) to a licensee not willing to grant a reciprocal license under its patent rights to You
and to any other party seeking such a license with respect to the enforcement of such licensee’s patent
claims where there is no technically feasible alternative that would avoid the infringement of such
claims (with respect to Your exercise of the rights described in subparagraphs (a) through (c)
immediately above);
JSPA - 2.0.1 19 October 2015 7
(bb) if the Spec arises from a JSR for which Community Review has closed after
termination of your membership in the JCP;
(cc) with respect to any portion of any product and any combinations thereof the sole
purpose or function of which is not required in order to be fully compliant with the Spec;
(dd) with respect to technology that is not required for at least one of the following:
using the Reference Implementation, using the TCK, or developing, distributing or using an
Independent Implementation; or
(ee) if, with respect to the Spec (or RI or TCK related thereto) in question, You
identify prior to Public Review the nature of the perceived infringement with specificity as set forth
below. However, if the draft Spec in question is modified in response to comments received during
Public Review, then You may exercise the right granted pursuant to this subparagraph (ee) not to grant
a license but only with respect to those of your patents for which the perceived inability to avoid their
infringement arose as a result of changes made to the Spec in response to such comments, and only if
the notice and disclosure requirements of this subparagraph (ee) are met prior to Final Approval Ballot.
For issued patents for which you invoke this subparagraph (ee) You must disclose in writing to the Spec
Lead and the PMO the country in which the patent issued and the patent number for such patent, and
for pending patent applications You must disclose, also to the Spec Lead and the PMO the country in
which the patent was filed, as well as the serial number and filing date for the application. In addition,
for pending applications either of the following shall be disclosed to the Spec Lead and the PMO: (1) a
copy of the pending patent application; or (2) identification of the portion(s) of the Spec to which the
claims in the pending application are expected to apply, and a copy of the broadest such claim filed in
the pending application. For any patent or patent application for which You elect not to grant a license
pursuant to this subparagraph (ee), in addition to identifying such patent or patent application you must
also identify the portion of the Spec where you think the infringement would arise and explain the
nature of the infringement. For the avoidance of doubt, you may only invoke your rights under this
Section (to refuse to license) with respect to the portion of the Spec identified in your disclosure
document.
Any disclosure to the Spec Lead and the PMO of Your election not to grant a license pursuant to
subparagraph (ee) above shall be considered to remain in effect unless and until You provide notice to
the Spec Lead and the PMO that You are revoking such election.
Subject to Section 6.C below, the provisions required of and extended to You under this Section 6.A
shall apply to Oracle with respect to Specifications under JSRs for which Oracle is not the Spec Lead.
B. Disclosure. In addition to the disclosure requirements of Section 6.A(ee), each
individual who represents a Member on an Expert Group shall disclose to that Expert Group promptly
after he or she acquires such knowledge the existence of any issued patents the infringement of which,
to the individual’s actual knowledge, cannot be avoided in a technically feasible manner in order to
implement such Spec. The individual does not represent that they have knowledge of all potentially
pertinent patents or other intellectual property rights owned or claimed by a Participant.
C. Effect on Existing Agreements. No provision of this Section 6 shall be understood to
require Oracle to modify license agreements for Java technology that Oracle has in place, or to modify
or replace in future license agreements for Java technology provisions comparable to those currently in
place, with respect to Oracle’s granting of license for (or covenants not to assert) its patent claims
where there is no technically feasible alternative that would avoid the infringement of such claims
(with respect to Your exercise of the rights described in Section 6.A.[a]-[c]).
JSPA - 2.0.1 19 October 2015 8
7. No Obligations. Except as expressly set forth herein, neither this Agreement, nor any disclosure of
information hereunder, in any way: (i) grants to Oracle, You, or any other party any right or license
under any copyright, patent, mask work, trademark or other intellectual property right now or hereafter
owned or controlled by the other party; (ii) obligates You or Oracle to disclose or receive any
information, perform any work, or enter into any license, business engagement or other agreement; (iii)
limits You or Oracle from developing, manufacturing or marketing products or services which may be
competitive with those of another Member or any other party; (iv) creates any joint relationship or
authorizes You or Oracle to act or speak on behalf of the other; or (v) limits You or Oracle from
entering into any business relationship with other parties.
8. Use of Trademarks. Subject to any other rights and obligations You may have pursuant to other
agreements with Oracle with respect to the use of trademarks owned or otherwise licensable by the
Oracle, You may refer to Oracle’s Java technology or programming language to the same extent as the
general public, provided that such reference is not misleading or likely to cause confusion. The Third
Party Usage Guidelines for Oracle Trademarks are currently available on the web at
http://www.oracle.com/html/3party.html.
9. Confidentiality.
A. Duty of Confidentiality. Prior to Public Review, or other public dissemination of the
Spec by the Spec Lead (which the Spec Lead may authorize unless prohibited or otherwise limited by
the Process), or the elapse of three years from the date of disclosure in the case of Information
exchanged within the Expert Group and not incorporated into the Spec, Confidential Information shall
neither be: (i) disclosed to third parties that are not also Members; nor (ii) used for any purpose
unrelated to the goals of the JCP which include, for example, the development or review of draft
Specifications and development of commercial products or services intended for use in conjunction
with compliant implementations of the Spec. A receiving party’s obligations to protect Confidential
Information shall expire upon release of the pertinent Spec for Public Review or other public
dissemination of the Spec by the Spec Lead, except for Confidential Information exchanged within the
Expert Group and not incorporated into the Spec, which shall be maintained as confidential for a period
of three (3) years after disclosure.
B. Limitations. This Agreement imposes no obligation upon the receiving party with
respect to Information which: (a) was in the possession of, or was known by, the receiving party prior
to its receipt from disclosing party, without an obligation to maintain its confidentiality; (b) is or
becomes generally known to the public without violation of this Agreement; (c) is obtained by the
receiving party from a third party, without an obligation to keep such information confidential; or (d) is
independently developed by the receiving party without use of Information disclosed by another party.
Disclosure of Information by the receiving party is not prohibited if prior notice is given to disclosing
party and such disclosure is: (a) compelled pursuant to a legal proceeding or (b) otherwise required by
law. Parties may disclose Information to subsidiaries and/or to third party contractors who have entered
into a written confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as the terms of this Section 9.
C. Residuals. This Agreement is not intended to prevent the receiving party from using
Residual Knowledge, subject to any valid patents and copyrights of the disclosing party. Residual
Knowledge means Information that is retained in the unaided memories of the receiving party’s
employees who have had access to Information. Further, both parties recognize that their receipt of
Information under this Agreement shall not create an obligation in any way limiting or restricting the
work assignments of employees within either party’s organization.
JSPA - 2.0.1 19 October 2015 9
10. Term and Termination. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless
