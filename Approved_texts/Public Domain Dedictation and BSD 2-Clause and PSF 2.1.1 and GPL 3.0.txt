Copyright:	This document has been placed in the public domain.
Most of the files included in this project have been placed in the public domain, and therefore have no license requirements and no restrictions on copying or usage; see the Public Domain Dedication below. There are a few exceptions, listed below. Files in the Sandbox are not distributed with Docutils releases and may have different license terms.

Public Domain Dedication
The persons who have associated their work with this project (the "Dedicator": David Goodger and the many contributors to the Docutils project) hereby dedicate the entire copyright, less the exceptions listed below, in the work of authorship known as "Docutils" identified below (the "Work") to the public domain.

The primary repository for the Work is the Internet World Wide Web site <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>. The Work consists of the files within the "docutils" module of the Docutils project Subversion repository (Internet host docutils.svn.sourceforge.net, filesystem path /svnroot/docutils), whose Internet web interface is located at <http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/docutils/>. Files dedicated to the public domain may be identified by the inclusion, near the beginning of each file, of a declaration of the form:

Copyright: This document/module/DTD/stylesheet/file/etc. has been
           placed in the public domain.
Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or conceived.

(This dedication is derived from the text of the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication. [1])

[1]	Creative Commons has retired this legal tool and does not recommend that it be applied to works: This tool is based on United States law and may not be applicable outside the US. For dedicating new works to the public domain, Creative Commons recommend the replacement Public Domain Dedication CC0 (CC zero, "No Rights Reserved"). So does the Free Software Foundation in its license-list.
