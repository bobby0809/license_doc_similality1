Comment

This is the license of the original implementation of the JSON data
interchange format. This license uses the Expat license as a base, but
adds a clause mandating: “The Software shall be used for Good, not
Evil.” This is a restriction on usage and thus conflicts with freedom
0. The restriction might be unenforcible, but we cannot presume
that. Thus, the license is nonfree.
