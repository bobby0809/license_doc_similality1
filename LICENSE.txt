You may believe that I have the copyright of this software and

I was tired.
So don't expect anything from me!

I am expecting a "wise person" to tell me that I
 should stop publishing my obsolete code.

However, the "bad guys" betraying you may argue that:
  -- I have no right.
  -- My(bad guys) deliverables are my own deliverables.
  -- The deliverables you generate using this software 
     are also my(bad guys) deliverables.

If you want to follow the "bad guys" someday, 
On your deliverables created using this software,
You will need to show the next CREDIT:
  -- "Powered by <this software name>"

Rather, I hope you promote the emergence of "wise person".
