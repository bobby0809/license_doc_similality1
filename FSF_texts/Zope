Digital Creations requests that attribution be given to Zope
   in any manner possible. Zope includes a "Powered by Zope"
   button that is installed by default. While it is not a license
   violation to remove this button, it is requested that the
   attribution remain. A significant investment has been put
   into Zope, and this effort will continue if the Zope community
   continues to grow. This is one way to assure that growth.

   In the event that the product being advertised includes an
   intact Zope distribution (with copyright and license included)
   then this clause is waived.

   Intact (re-)distributions of any official Zope release do not

Modifications are encouraged but must be packaged separately as
   patches to official Zope releases.  Distributions that do not
   clearly separate the patches from the original work must be clearly
   labeled as unofficial distributions.  Modifications which do not

   conform to all of the clauses above.
