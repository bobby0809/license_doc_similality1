This licence is apt for any kind of work (such as source code, fonts, documentation, graphics,
             sound etc.) and the preferred terms for work added to MirBSD. It has been drafted as
             universally usable equivalent of the &quot;historic permission notice&quot;(2) adapted to Europen law
             because in some (droit d'auteur) countries authors cannot disclaim all liabi‚Äê lities.
             Compliance to DFSG(3) 1.1 is ensured, and GPLv2 compatibility is asserted unless advertising
             clauses are used. The MirOS Licence is certified to conform to OKD(4) 1.0 and OSD(5) 1.9, and
             qualifies as a Free Software(6) and also Free Documentation(7) licence and is included in some
             relevant lists(8)(9)(10). 
      </p>

         <p>We believe you are not liable for work inserted which is intellectual property of third parties, if you
         were not aware of the fact, act appropriately as soon as you become aware of that problem, seek an
         amicable solution for all parties, and never knowingly distribute a work without being authorised to
         do so by its licensors.
