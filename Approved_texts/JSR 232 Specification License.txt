License Grant

OSGi Alliance (“OSGi”) hereby grants you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited license (without the right to sublicense), under OSGi’s applicable intellectual property rights to view, download, and reproduce this OSGi Specification (“Specification”) which follows this License Agreement (“Agreement”). You are not authorized to create any derivative work of the Specification. However, to the extent that an implementation of the Specification would necessarily be a derivative work of the Specification, OSGi also grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to sublicense) under any applicable copyrights, to create and/or distribute an implementation of the Specification that: (i) fully implements the Specification including all its required interfaces and functionality; (ii) does not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the OSGi Name Space, or include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within the OSGi Name Space other than those required and authorized by the Specification. An implementation that does not satisfy limitations (i)-(ii) is not considered an implementation of the Specification, does not receive the benefits of this license, and must not be described as an implementation of the Specification. An implementation of the Specification must not claim to be a compliant implementation of the Specification unless it passes the OSGi Compliance Tests for the Specification in accordance with OSGi processes. “OSGi Name Space” shall mean the public class or interface declarations whose names begin with “org.osgi” or any recognized successors or replacements thereof.

OSGi Participants (as such term is defined in the OSGi Intellectual Property Rights Policy) have made non-assert and licensing commitments regarding patent claims necessary to implement the Specification, if any, under the OSGi Intellectual Property Rights Policy which is available for examination on the OSGi public web site (www.osgi.org).

OSGi AND ANY OTHER AUTHORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY USE OF THE SPECIFICATION OR THE PERFORMANCE OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTENTS THEREOF.
