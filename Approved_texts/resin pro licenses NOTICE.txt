Requesting Resin Pro License
If you don't have a license file and would like to request one please proceed to request evaluation Resin Professional license. Once you apply, please check your mail-box, the license should already be there.

Resin Pro License Deployment
The simplest way to deploy a license is to copy it into licenses directory under Resin Home.

Resin Pro is looking for licenses in the following locations

Directory specified with -Dresin.license.dir JVM parameter
licenses directory in your working directory, i.e. System.getProperty("user.dir")
licenses directory in Resin Home.
Troubleshooting
If something went wrong and Resin Pro can't find license, the first place to check for problems is the log files.

If the message in the log file isn't giving enough detail you can set logging level to a higher value ('finest') and restart Resin with -verbose option.
